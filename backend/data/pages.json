Example Create it Create a file main.py with: from typing import Union from fastapi import FastAPI app = FastAPI () @app . get ( \"/\" ) def read_root (): return { \"Hello\" : \"World\" } @app . get ( \"/items/ {item_id} \" ) def read_item ( item_id : int , q : Union [ str , None ] = None ): return { \"item_id\" : item_id , \"q\" : q } Or use async def ... If your code uses async / await , use async def : from typing import Union from fastapi import FastAPI app = FastAPI () @app . get ( \"/\" ) async def read_root (): return { \"Hello\" : \"World\" } @app . get ( \"/items/ {item_id} \" ) async def read_item ( item_id : int , q : Union [ str , None ] = None ): return { \"item_id\" : item_id , \"q\" : q } Note : If you don't know, check the \"In a hurry?\" section about async and await in the docs .

INFO:     Application startup complete. About the command fastapi dev main.py ... The command fastapi dev reads your main.py file, detects the FastAPI app in it, and starts a server using Uvicorn . By default, fastapi dev will start with auto-reload enabled for local development. You can read more about it in the FastAPI CLI docs . Check it Open your browser at http://127.0.0.1:8000/items/5?q=somequery . You will see the JSON response as: { \"item_id\" : 5 , \"q\" : \"somequery\" } You already created an API that: Receives HTTP requests in the paths / and /items/{item_id} . Both paths take GET operations (also known as HTTP methods ). The path /items/{item_id} has a path parameter item_id that should be an int . The path /items/{item_id} has an optional str query parameter q . Interactive API docs Now go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs . You will see the automatic interactive API documentation (provided by Swagger UI ): Alternative API docs And now, go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc . You will see the alternative automatic documentation (provided by ReDoc ): Example upgrade Now modify the file main.py to receive a body from a PUT request. Declare the body using standard Python types, thanks to Pydantic. from typing import Union from fastapi import FastAPI from pydantic import BaseModel app = FastAPI () class Item ( BaseModel ): name : str price : float is_offer : Union [ bool , None ] = None @app . get ( \"/\" ) def read_root (): return { \"Hello\" : \"World\" } @app . get ( \"/items/ {item_id} \" ) def read_item ( item_id : int , q : Union [ str , None ] = None ): return { \"item_id\" : item_id , \"q\" : q } @app . put ( \"/items/ {item_id} \" ) def update_item ( item_id : int , item : Item ): return { \"item_name\" : item . name , \"item_id\" : item_id } The fastapi dev server should reload automatically. Interactive API docs upgrade Now go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs . The interactive API documentation will be automatically updated, including the new body: Click on the button \"Try it out\", it allows you to fill the parameters and directly interact with the API: Then click on the \"Execute\" button, the user interface will communicate with your API, send the parameters, get the results and show them on the screen: Alternative API docs upgrade And now, go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc . The alternative documentation will also reflect the new query parameter and body: Recap In summary, you declare once the types of parameters, body, etc. as function parameters. You do that with standard modern Python types. You don't have to learn a new syntax, the methods or classes of a specific library, etc. Just standard Python . For example, for an int : or for a more complex Item model: ...and with that single declaration you get: Editor support, including: Validation of data: Automatic and clear errors when the data is invalid. Validation even for deeply nested JSON objects. Conversion of input data: coming from the network to Python data and types. Reading from: JSON. Path parameters. Query parameters. Cookies. Headers. Forms. Files. Conversion of output data: converting from Python data and types to network data (as JSON): Convert Python types ( str , int , float , bool , list , etc). datetime objects. UUID objects. Database models. ...and many more. Automatic interactive API documentation, including 2 alternative user interfaces: Coming back to the previous code example, FastAPI will: Validate that there is an item_id in the path for GET and PUT requests. Validate that the item_id is of type int for GET and PUT requests. If it is not, the client will see a useful, clear error. Check if there is an optional query parameter named q (as in http://127.0.0.1:8000/items/foo?q=somequery ) for GET requests. As the q parameter is declared with = None , it is optional. Without the None it would be required (as is the body in the case with PUT ). For PUT requests to /items/{item_id} , read the body as JSON: Check that it has a required attribute name that should be a str . Check that it has a required attribute price that has to be a float . Check that it has an optional attribute is_offer , that should be a bool , if present. All this would also work for deeply nested JSON objects. Convert from and to JSON automatically. Document everything with OpenAPI, that can be used by: Interactive documentation systems. Automatic client code generation systems, for many languages. Provide 2 interactive documentation web interfaces directly. We just scratched the surface, but you already get the idea of how it all works. Try changing the line with: return { \"item_name\" : item . name , \"item_id\" : item_id } ...from: ... \"item_name\" : item . name ... ...to: ... \"item_price\" : item . price ... ...and see how your editor will auto-complete the attributes and know their types: For a more complete example including more features, see the Tutorial - User Guide . Spoiler alert : the tutorial - user guide includes: Declaration of parameters from other different places as: headers , cookies , form fields and files . How to set validation constraints as maximum_length or regex . A very powerful and easy to use Dependency Injection system. Security and authentication, including support for OAuth2 with JWT tokens and HTTP Basic auth. More advanced (but equally easy) techniques for declaring deeply nested JSON models (thanks to Pydantic). GraphQL integration with Strawberry and other libraries. Many extra features (thanks to Starlette) as: WebSockets extremely easy tests based on HTTPX and pytest CORS Cookie Sessions ...and more. Performance Independent TechEmpower benchmarks show FastAPI applications running under Uvicorn as one of the fastest Python frameworks available , only below Starlette and Uvicorn themselves (used internally by FastAPI). (*) To understand more about it, see the section Benchmarks . Dependencies FastAPI depends on Pydantic and Starlette. standard Dependencies When you install FastAPI with pip install \"fastapi[standard]\" it comes with the standard group of optional dependencies: Used by Pydantic: Used by Starlette: httpx - Required if you want to use the TestClient . jinja2 - Required if you want to use the default template configuration. python-multipart - Required if you want to support form \"parsing\" , with request.form() . Used by FastAPI: uvicorn - for the server that loads and serves your application. This includes uvicorn[standard] , which includes some dependencies (e.g. uvloop ) needed for high performance serving. fastapi-cli[standard] - to provide the fastapi command. This includes fastapi-cloud-cli , which allows you to deploy your FastAPI application to FastAPI Cloud . Without standard Dependencies If you don't want to include the standard optional dependencies, you can install with pip install fastapi instead of pip install \"fastapi[standard]\" . Without fastapi-cloud-cli If you want to install FastAPI with the standard dependencies but without the fastapi-cloud-cli , you can install with pip install \"fastapi[standard-no-fastapi-cloud-cli]\" . Additional Optional Dependencies There are some additional dependencies you might want to install. Additional optional Pydantic dependencies: Additional optional FastAPI dependencies: orjson - Required if you want to use ORJSONResponse . ujson - Required if you want to use UJSONResponse .

Der Befehl fastapi dev liest Ihre main.py -Datei, erkennt die FastAPI -App darin und startet einen Server mit Uvicorn . Standardmäßig wird fastapi dev mit aktiviertem Auto-Reload für die lokale Entwicklung gestartet. Sie können mehr darüber in der FastAPI CLI Dokumentation lesen. Es testen Öffnen Sie Ihren Browser unter http://127.0.0.1:8000/items/5?q=somequery . Sie sehen die JSON- Response als: { \"item_id\" : 5 , \"q\" : \"somequery\" } Sie haben bereits eine API erstellt, welche: HTTP- Requests auf den Pfaden / und /items/{item_id} entgegennimmt. Beide Pfade nehmen GET Operationen (auch bekannt als HTTP- Methoden ) entgegen. Der Pfad /items/{item_id} hat einen Pfad-Parameter item_id , der ein int sein sollte. Der Pfad /items/{item_id} hat einen optionalen str - Query-Parameter q . Interaktive API-Dokumentation Gehen Sie nun auf http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs . Sie sehen die automatische interaktive API-Dokumentation (bereitgestellt von Swagger UI ): Alternative API-Dokumentation Und jetzt gehen Sie auf http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc . Sie sehen die alternative automatische Dokumentation (bereitgestellt von ReDoc ): Beispiel Aktualisierung Ändern Sie jetzt die Datei main.py , um den Body eines PUT -Requests zu empfangen. Deklarieren Sie den Body mit Standard-Python-Typen, dank Pydantic. from typing import Union from fastapi import FastAPI from pydantic import BaseModel app = FastAPI () class Item ( BaseModel ): name : str price : float is_offer : Union [ bool , None ] = None @app . get ( \"/\" ) def read_root (): return { \"Hello\" : \"World\" } @app . get ( \"/items/ {item_id} \" ) def read_item ( item_id : int , q : Union [ str , None ] = None ): return { \"item_id\" : item_id , \"q\" : q } @app . put ( \"/items/ {item_id} \" ) def update_item ( item_id : int , item : Item ): return { \"item_name\" : item . name , \"item_id\" : item_id } Der fastapi dev -Server sollte automatisch neu laden. Interaktive API-Dokumentation aktualisieren Gehen Sie jetzt auf http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs . Die interaktive API-Dokumentation wird automatisch aktualisiert, einschließlich des neuen Bodys: Klicken Sie auf den Button „Try it out“, damit können Sie die Parameter ausfüllen und direkt mit der API interagieren: Klicken Sie dann auf den Button „Execute“, die Benutzeroberfläche wird mit Ihrer API kommunizieren, sendet die Parameter, holt die Ergebnisse und zeigt sie auf dem Bildschirm an: Alternative API-Dokumentation aktualisieren Und jetzt gehen Sie auf http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc . Die alternative Dokumentation wird ebenfalls den neuen Query-Parameter und Body widerspiegeln: Zusammenfassung Zusammengefasst deklarieren Sie einmal die Typen von Parametern, Body, usw. als Funktionsparameter. Das machen Sie mit modernen Standard-Python-Typen. Sie müssen keine neue Syntax, Methoden oder Klassen einer bestimmten Bibliothek usw. lernen. Nur Standard- Python . Zum Beispiel für ein int : oder für ein komplexeres Item -Modell: ... und mit dieser einen Deklaration erhalten Sie: Editor-Unterstützung, einschließlich: Code-Vervollständigung. Typprüfungen. Validierung von Daten: Automatische und eindeutige Fehler, wenn die Daten ungültig sind. Validierung sogar für tief verschachtelte JSON-Objekte. Konvertierung von Eingabedaten: Aus dem Netzwerk kommend, zu Python-Daten und -Typen. Lesen von: JSON. Pfad-Parametern. Query-Parametern. Cookies. Headern. Formularen. Dateien. Konvertierung von Ausgabedaten: Konvertierung von Python-Daten und -Typen zu Netzwerkdaten (als JSON): Konvertieren von Python-Typen ( str , int , float , bool , list , usw.). datetime -Objekte. UUID -Objekte. Datenbankmodelle. ... und viele mehr. Automatische interaktive API-Dokumentation, einschließlich zwei alternativer Benutzeroberflächen: Um auf das vorherige Codebeispiel zurückzukommen, FastAPI wird: Validieren, dass es eine item_id im Pfad für GET - und PUT -Requests gibt. Validieren, ob die item_id vom Typ int für GET - und PUT -Requests ist. Falls nicht, sieht der Client einen hilfreichen, klaren Fehler. Prüfen, ob es einen optionalen Query-Parameter namens q (wie in http://127.0.0.1:8000/items/foo?q=somequery ) für GET -Requests gibt. Da der q -Parameter mit = None deklariert ist, ist er optional. Ohne das None wäre er erforderlich (wie der Body im Fall von PUT ). Bei PUT -Requests an /items/{item_id} den Body als JSON lesen: Prüfen, ob er ein erforderliches Attribut name hat, das ein str sein muss. Prüfen, ob er ein erforderliches Attribut price hat, das ein float sein muss. Prüfen, ob er ein optionales Attribut is_offer hat, das ein bool sein muss, falls vorhanden. All dies würde auch für tief verschachtelte JSON-Objekte funktionieren. Automatisch von und nach JSON konvertieren. Alles mit OpenAPI dokumentieren, welches verwendet werden kann von: Interaktiven Dokumentationssystemen. Automatisch Client-Code generierenden Systemen für viele Sprachen. Zwei interaktive Dokumentations-Weboberflächen direkt bereitstellen. Wir haben nur an der Oberfläche gekratzt, aber Sie bekommen schon eine Vorstellung davon, wie das Ganze funktioniert. Versuchen Sie, diese Zeile zu ändern: return { \"item_name\" : item . name , \"item_id\" : item_id } ... von: ... \"item_name\" : item . name ... ... zu: ... \"item_price\" : item . price ... ... und sehen Sie, wie Ihr Editor die Attribute automatisch vervollständigt und ihre Typen kennt: Für ein vollständigeres Beispiel, mit weiteren Funktionen, siehe das Tutorial – Benutzerhandbuch . Spoiler-Alarm : Das Tutorial – Benutzerhandbuch enthält: Deklaration von Parametern von anderen verschiedenen Stellen wie: Header , Cookies , Formularfelder und Dateien . Wie man Validierungs-Constraints wie maximum_length oder regex setzt. Ein sehr leistungsfähiges und einfach zu bedienendes System für Dependency Injection . Sicherheit und Authentifizierung, einschließlich Unterstützung für OAuth2 mit JWT-Tokens und HTTP Basic Authentifizierung. Fortgeschrittenere (aber ebenso einfache) Techniken zur Deklaration tief verschachtelter JSON-Modelle (dank Pydantic). GraphQL -Integration mit Strawberry und anderen Bibliotheken. Viele zusätzliche Features (dank Starlette) wie: WebSockets extrem einfache Tests auf Basis von HTTPX und pytest CORS Cookie-Sessions ... und mehr. Performanz Unabhängige TechEmpower-Benchmarks zeigen FastAPI -Anwendungen, die unter Uvicorn laufen, als eines der schnellsten verfügbaren Python-Frameworks , nur hinter Starlette und Uvicorn selbst (intern von FastAPI verwendet). (*) Um mehr darüber zu erfahren, siehe den Abschnitt Benchmarks . Abhängigkeiten FastAPI hängt von Pydantic und Starlette ab. standard -Abhängigkeiten Wenn Sie FastAPI mit pip install \"fastapi[standard]\" installieren, kommt es mit der standard -Gruppe optionaler Abhängigkeiten: Verwendet von Pydantic: Verwendet von Starlette: httpx – erforderlich, wenn Sie den TestClient verwenden möchten. jinja2 – erforderlich, wenn Sie die Default-Template-Konfiguration verwenden möchten. python-multipart – erforderlich, wenn Sie Formulare mittels request.form() „parsen“ möchten. Verwendet von FastAPI: uvicorn – für den Server, der Ihre Anwendung lädt und bereitstellt. Dies umfasst uvicorn[standard] , das einige Abhängigkeiten (z. B. uvloop ) beinhaltet, die für eine Bereitstellung mit hoher Performanz benötigt werden. fastapi-cli[standard] – um den fastapi -Befehl bereitzustellen. Dies beinhaltet fastapi-cloud-cli , das es Ihnen ermöglicht, Ihre FastAPI-Anwendung auf FastAPI Cloud bereitzustellen. Ohne standard -Abhängigkeiten Wenn Sie die standard optionalen Abhängigkeiten nicht einschließen möchten, können Sie mit pip install fastapi statt pip install \"fastapi[standard]\" installieren. Ohne fastapi-cloud-cli Wenn Sie FastAPI mit den Standardabhängigkeiten, aber ohne das fastapi-cloud-cli installieren möchten, können Sie mit pip install \"fastapi[standard-no-fastapi-cloud-cli]\" installieren. Zusätzliche optionale Abhängigkeiten Es gibt einige zusätzliche Abhängigkeiten, die Sie installieren möchten. Zusätzliche optionale Pydantic-Abhängigkeiten: Zusätzliche optionale FastAPI-Abhängigkeiten: orjson – erforderlich, wenn Sie ORJSONResponse verwenden möchten. ujson – erforderlich, wenn Sie UJSONResponse verwenden möchten.

Objetos UUID . Modelos de base de datos. ...y muchos más. Documentación interactiva automática de la API, incluyendo 2 interfaces de usuario alternativas: Volviendo al ejemplo de código anterior, FastAPI : Validará que haya un item_id en el path para requests GET y PUT . Validará que el item_id sea del tipo int para requests GET y PUT . Si no lo es, el cliente verá un error útil y claro. Comprobará si hay un parámetro de query opcional llamado q (como en http://127.0.0.1:8000/items/foo?q=somequery ) para requests GET . Como el parámetro q está declarado con = None , es opcional. Sin el None sería requerido (como lo es el body en el caso con PUT ). Para requests PUT a /items/{item_id} , leerá el body como JSON: Comprobará que tiene un atributo requerido name que debe ser un str . Comprobará que tiene un atributo requerido price que debe ser un float . Comprobará que tiene un atributo opcional is_offer , que debe ser un bool , si está presente. Todo esto también funcionaría para objetos JSON profundamente anidados. Convertirá de y a JSON automáticamente. Documentará todo con OpenAPI, que puede ser usado por: Sistemas de documentación interactiva. Sistemas de generación automática de código cliente, para muchos lenguajes. Proporcionará 2 interfaces web de documentación interactiva directamente. Solo tocamos los conceptos básicos, pero ya te haces una idea de cómo funciona todo. Intenta cambiar la línea con: return { \"item_name\" : item . name , \"item_id\" : item_id } ...desde: ... \"item_name\" : item . name ... ...a: ... \"item_price\" : item . price ... ...y observa cómo tu editor autocompleta los atributos y conoce sus tipos: Para un ejemplo más completo incluyendo más funcionalidades, ve al Tutorial - Guía del Usuario . Alerta de spoilers : el tutorial - guía del usuario incluye: Declaración de parámetros desde otros lugares diferentes como: headers , cookies , campos de formulario y archivos . Cómo establecer restricciones de validación como maximum_length o regex . Un sistema de Inyección de Dependencias muy poderoso y fácil de usar. Seguridad y autenticación, incluyendo soporte para OAuth2 con tokens JWT y autenticación HTTP Basic . Técnicas más avanzadas (pero igualmente fáciles) para declarar modelos JSON profundamente anidados (gracias a Pydantic). Integración con GraphQL usando Strawberry y otros paquetes. Muchas funcionalidades extra (gracias a Starlette) como: WebSockets pruebas extremadamente fáciles basadas en HTTPX y pytest CORS Sesiones de Cookies ...y más.

دکمه \"Execute\" کلیک کنید، خواهید دید که واسط کاربری با APIهای تعریف شده ارتباط برقرار کرده، پارامترهای مورد نیاز را به آن‌ها ارسال می‌کند، سپس نتایج را دریافت کرده و در صفحه نشان می‌دهد: تغییر مستندات API جایگزین حال به آدرس http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc بروید. خواهید دید که مستندات جایگزین نیز به‌روزرسانی شده و شامل پارامتر پرسمان و بدنه تعریف شده می‌باشد: خلاصه به طور خلاصه شما یک بار انواع پارامترها، بدنه و غیره را به عنوان پارامترهای ورودی تابع خود تعریف می‌کنید. این کار را با استفاده از انواع استاندارد و مدرن موجود در پایتون انجام می‌دهید. نیازی به یادگیری نحو جدید یا متدها و کلاس‌های یک کتابخانه بخصوص و غیره نیست. تنها پایتون +۳.۶ . به عنوان مثال برای یک پارامتر از نوع int : یا برای یک مدل پیچیده‌تر مثل Item : ...و با همین اعلان تمامی قابلیت‌های زیر در دسترس قرار می‌گیرد: پشتیبانی ویرایشگر متنی شامل: تکمیل کد. بررسی انواع داده. اعتبارسنجی داده: خطاهای خودکار و مشخص در هنگام نامعتبر بودن داده. اعتبارسنجی، حتی برای اشیاء JSON تو در تو. تبدیل داده ورودی: که از شبکه رسیده به انواع و داد‌ه‌ پایتونی. این داده‌ شامل: JSON. پارامترهای مسیر . پارامترهای پرسمان . کوکی‌ها . سرآیند‌ها (هدرها) . فرم‌ها . فایل‌ها . تبدیل داده خروجی: تبدیل از انواع و داده‌ پایتون به داده شبکه  (مانند JSON): تبدیل انواع داده پایتونی ( str , int , float , bool , list و غیره). اشیاء datetime . اشیاء UUID . qمدل‌های پایگاه‌داده. و موارد بیشمار دیگر. دو مدل مستند API تعاملی خودکار : به مثال قبلی باز می‌گردیم، در این مثال FastAPI موارد زیر را انجام می‌دهد: اعتبارسنجی اینکه پارامتر item_id در مسیر درخواست‌های GET و PUT موجود است. اعتبارسنجی اینکه پارامتر item_id در درخواست‌های GET و PUT از نوع int است. اگر غیر از این موارد باشد، سرویس‌گیرنده خطای مفید و مشخصی دریافت خواهد کرد. بررسی وجود پارامتر پرسمان اختیاری q (مانند http://127.0.0.1:8000/items/foo?q=somequery ) در درخواست‌های GET . از آنجا که پارامتر q با = None مقداردهی شده است، این پارامتر اختیاری است. اگر از مقدار اولیه None استفاده نکنیم، این پارامتر الزامی خواهد بود (همانند بدنه درخواست در درخواست PUT ). برای درخواست‌های PUT به آدرس /items/{item_id} ، بدنه درخواست باید از نوع JSON تعریف شده باشد: بررسی اینکه بدنه شامل فیلدی با نام name و از نوع str است. بررسی اینکه بدنه شامل فیلدی با نام price و از نوع float است. بررسی اینکه بدنه شامل فیلدی اختیاری با نام is_offer است، که در صورت وجود باید از نوع bool باشد. تمامی این موارد برای اشیاء JSON در هر عمقی قابل بررسی می‌باشد. تبدیل از/به JSON به صورت خودکار. مستندسازی همه چیز با استفاده از OpenAPI، که می‌توان از آن برای موارد زیر استفاده کرد: سیستم مستندات تعاملی. تولید خودکار کد سرویس‌گیرنده‌ در زبان‌های برنامه‌نویسی بیشمار. فراهم سازی ۲ مستند تعاملی مبتنی بر وب به صورت پیش‌فرض. موارد ذکر شده تنها پاره‌ای از ویژگی‌های بیشمار FastAPI است اما ایده‌ای کلی از طرز کار آن در اختیار قرار می‌دهد. خط زیر را به این صورت تغییر دهید: return { \"item_name\" : item . name , \"item_id\" : item_id } از: ... \"item_name\" : item . name ... به: ... \"item_price\" : item . price ... در حین تایپ کردن توجه کنید که چگونه ویرایش‌گر، ویژگی‌های کلاس Item را تشخیص داده و به تکمیل خودکار آنها کمک می‌کند: برای مشاهده مثال‌های کامل‌تر که شامل قابلیت‌های بیشتری از FastAPI باشد به بخش آموزش - راهنمای کاربر مراجعه کنید. هشدار اسپویل : بخش آموزش - راهنمای کاربر شامل موارد زیر است: اعلان پارامترهای موجود در بخش‌های دیگر درخواست، شامل: سرآیند‌ (هدر)ها ، کوکی‌ها ، فیلد‌های فرم و فایل‌ها . چگونگی تنظیم محدودیت‌های اعتبارسنجی به عنوان مثال maximum_length یا regex . سیستم Dependency Injection قوی و کاربردی. امنیت و تایید هویت, شامل پشتیبانی از OAuth2 مبتنی بر JWT tokens و HTTP Basic . تکنیک پیشرفته برای تعریف مدل‌های چند سطحی JSON (بر اساس Pydantic). قابلیت‌های اضافی دیگر (بر اساس Starlette) شامل: وب‌سوکت GraphQL تست‌های خودکار آسان مبتنی بر HTTPX و pytest CORS Cookie Sessions و موارد بیشمار دیگر. کارایی معیار (بنچمارک‌)های مستقل TechEmpower حاکی از آن است که برنامه‌های FastAPI که تحت Uvicorn اجرا می‌شود، یکی از سریع‌ترین فریم‌ورک‌های مبتنی بر پایتون ، است که کمی ضعیف‌تر از Starlette و Uvicorn عمل می‌کند (فریم‌ورک و سروری که FastAPI بر اساس آنها ایجاد شده است) (*) برای درک بهتری از این موضوع به بخش بنچ‌مارک‌ها مراجعه کنید. نیازمندی‌های اختیاری استفاده شده توسط Pydantic: استفاده شده توسط Starlette: HTTPX - در صورتی که می‌خواهید از TestClient استفاده کنید. aiofiles - در صورتی که می‌خواهید از FileResponse و StaticFiles استفاده کنید. jinja2 - در صورتی که بخواهید از پیکربندی پیش‌فرض برای قالب‌ها استفاده کنید. python-multipart - در صورتی که بخواهید با استفاده از request.form() از قابلیت \"تجزیه (parse)\" فرم استفاده کنید. itsdangerous - در صورتی که بخواید از SessionMiddleware پشتیبانی کنید. pyyaml - برای پشتیبانی SchemaGenerator در Starlet (به احتمال زیاد برای کار کردن با FastAPI به آن نیازی پیدا نمی‌کنید). graphene - در صورتی که از GraphQLApp پشتیبانی می‌کنید. استفاده شده توسط FastAPI / Starlette: uvicorn - برای سرور اجرا کننده برنامه وب. orjson - در صورتی که بخواهید از ORJSONResponse استفاده کنید. ujson - در صورتی که بخواهید از UJSONResponse استفاده کنید. می‌توان همه این موارد را با استفاده از دستور pip install fastapi[all] . به صورت یکجا نصب کرد. لایسنس این پروژه مشمول قوانین و مقررات لایسنس MIT است.",

Other sponsors Opinions \" [...] J'utilise beaucoup FastAPI ces derniers temps. [...] Je prévois de l'utiliser dans mon équipe pour tous les services de ML chez Microsoft . Certains d'entre eux seront intégrés dans le coeur de Windows et dans certains produits Office . \" Kabir Khan - Microsoft (ref) \" Nous avons adopté la bibliothèque FastAPI pour créer un serveur REST qui peut être interrogé pour obtenir des prédictions . [pour Ludwig] \" Piero Molino, Yaroslav Dudin et Sai Sumanth Miryala - Uber (ref) \" Netflix a le plaisir d'annoncer la sortie en open-source de notre framework d'orchestration de gestion de crise : Dispatch !

Il est bien conçu , simple à utiliser et très évolutif . Il est devenu un composant clé dans notre stratégie de développement API first et il est à l'origine de nombreux automatismes et services tels que notre ingénieur virtuel TAC. \" Deon Pillsbury - Cisco (ref) Typer , le FastAPI des CLI Si vous souhaitez construire une application CLI utilisable dans un terminal au lieu d'une API web, regardez Typer . Typer est le petit frère de FastAPI. Et il est destiné à être le FastAPI des CLI . ⌨️ 🚀 Prérequis FastAPI repose sur les épaules de géants : Installation $ pip install fastapi ---> 100% Vous aurez également besoin d'un serveur ASGI pour la production tel que Uvicorn ou Hypercorn . $ pip install \"uvicorn[standard]\" ---> 100% Exemple Créez Créez un fichier main.py avec : from typing import Union from fastapi import FastAPI app = FastAPI () @app . get ( \"/\" ) def read_root (): return { \"Hello\" : \"World\" } @app . get ( \"/items/ {item_id} \" ) def read_item ( item_id : int , q : Union [ str , None ] = None ): return { \"item_id\" : item_id , \"q\" : q } Ou utilisez async def ... Si votre code utilise async / await , utilisez async def : from typing import Union from fastapi import FastAPI app = FastAPI () @app . get ( \"/\" ) async def read_root (): return { \"Hello\" : \"World\" } @app . get ( \"/items/ {item_id} \" ) async def read_item ( item_id : int , q : Union [ str , None ] = None ): return { \"item_id\" : item_id , \"q\" : q } Note Si vous n'êtes pas familier avec cette notion, consultez la section \"Vous êtes pressés ?\" à propos de async et await dans la documentation . Lancez Lancez le serveur avec : $ uvicorn main:app --reload INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit) INFO:     Started reloader process [28720] INFO:     Started server process [28722] INFO:     Waiting for application startup. INFO:     Application startup complete. À propos de la commande uvicorn main:app --reload ... La commande uvicorn main:app fait référence à : main : le fichier main.py (le \"module\" Python). app : l'objet créé à l'intérieur de main.py avec la ligne app = FastAPI() . --reload : fait redémarrer le serveur après des changements de code. À n'utiliser que pour le développement. Vérifiez Ouvrez votre navigateur à l'adresse http://127.0.0.1:8000/items/5?q=somequery . Vous obtenez alors cette réponse JSON : { \"item_id\" : 5 , \"q\" : \"somequery\" } Vous venez de créer une API qui : Reçoit les requêtes HTTP pour les chemins / et /items/{item_id} . Les deux chemins acceptent des opérations GET (également connu sous le nom de méthodes HTTP). Le chemin /items/{item_id} a un paramètre item_id qui doit être un int . Le chemin /items/{item_id} a un paramètre de requête optionnel q de type str . Documentation API interactive Maintenant, rendez-vous sur http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs . Vous verrez la documentation interactive automatique de l'API (fournie par Swagger UI ) : Documentation API alternative Et maintenant, rendez-vous sur http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc . Vous verrez la documentation interactive automatique de l'API (fournie par ReDoc ) : Exemple plus poussé Maintenant, modifiez le fichier main.py pour recevoir le corps d'une requête PUT . Déclarez ce corps en utilisant les types Python standards, grâce à Pydantic. from typing import Union from fastapi import FastAPI from pydantic import BaseModel app = FastAPI () class Item ( BaseModel ): name : str price : float is_offer : Union [ bool , None ] = None @app . get ( \"/\" ) def read_root (): return { \"Hello\" : \"World\" } @app . get ( \"/items/ {item_id} \" ) def read_item ( item_id : int , q : Union [ str , None ] = None ): return { \"item_id\" : item_id , \"q\" : q } @app . put ( \"/items/ {item_id} \" ) def update_item ( item_id : int , item : Item ): return { \"item_name\" : item . name , \"item_id\" : item_id } Le serveur se recharge normalement automatiquement (car vous avez pensé à --reload dans la commande uvicorn ci-dessus). Plus loin avec la documentation API interactive Maintenant, rendez-vous sur http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs . La documentation interactive de l'API sera automatiquement mise à jour, y compris le nouveau corps de la requête : Cliquez sur le bouton \"Try it out\", il vous permet de renseigner les paramètres et d'interagir directement avec l'API : Cliquez ensuite sur le bouton \"Execute\", l'interface utilisateur communiquera avec votre API, enverra les paramètres, obtiendra les résultats et les affichera à l'écran : Plus loin avec la documentation API alternative Et maintenant, rendez-vous sur http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc . La documentation alternative reflétera également le nouveau paramètre de requête et le nouveau corps : En résumé En résumé, vous déclarez une fois les types de paramètres, le corps de la requête, etc. en tant que paramètres de fonction. Vous faites cela avec les types Python standard modernes. Vous n'avez pas à apprendre une nouvelle syntaxe, les méthodes ou les classes d'une bibliothèque spécifique, etc. Juste du Python standard. Par exemple, pour un int : ou pour un modèle Item plus complexe : ... et avec cette déclaration unique, vous obtenez : Une assistance dans votre IDE, notamment : la complétion. la vérification des types. La validation des données : des erreurs automatiques et claires lorsque les données ne sont pas valides. une validation même pour les objets JSON profondément imbriqués. Une conversion des données d'entrée : venant du réseau et allant vers les données et types de Python, permettant de lire : le JSON . les paramètres du chemin . les paramètres de la requête . les cookies. les en-têtes . les formulaires . les fichiers . La conversion des données de sortie : conversion des données et types Python en données réseau (au format JSON ), permettant de convertir : les types Python ( str , int , float , bool , list , etc). les objets datetime . les objets UUID . les modèles de base de données. ... et beaucoup plus. La documentation API interactive automatique, avec 2 interfaces utilisateur au choix : Pour revenir à l'exemple de code précédent, FastAPI permet de : Valider que item_id existe dans le chemin des requêtes GET et PUT . Valider que item_id est de type int pour les requêtes GET et PUT . Si ce n'est pas le cas, le client voit une erreur utile et claire. Vérifier qu'il existe un paramètre de requête facultatif nommé q (comme dans http://127.0.0.1:8000/items/foo?q=somequery ) pour les requêtes GET . Puisque le paramètre q est déclaré avec = None , il est facultatif. Sans le None , il serait nécessaire (comme l'est le corps de la requête dans le cas du PUT ). Pour les requêtes PUT vers /items/{item_id} , de lire le corps en JSON : Vérifier qu'il a un attribut obligatoire name qui devrait être un str . Vérifier qu'il a un attribut obligatoire prix qui doit être un float . Vérifier qu'il a un attribut facultatif is_offer , qui devrait être un bool , s'il est présent. Tout cela fonctionnerait également pour les objets JSON profondément imbriqués. Convertir de et vers JSON automatiquement. Documenter tout avec OpenAPI, qui peut être utilisé par : Les systèmes de documentation interactifs. Les systèmes de génération automatique de code client, pour de nombreuses langues. Fournir directement 2 interfaces web de documentation interactive. Nous n'avons fait qu'effleurer la surface, mais vous avez déjà une idée de la façon dont tout cela fonctionne. Essayez de changer la ligne contenant : return { \"item_name\" : item . name , \"item_id\" : item_id } ... de : ... \"item_name\" : item . name ... ... vers : ... \"item_price\" : item . price ... ... et voyez comment votre éditeur complétera automatiquement les attributs et connaîtra leurs types : Pour un exemple plus complet comprenant plus de fonctionnalités, voir le Tutoriel - Guide utilisateur . Spoiler alert : le tutoriel - guide utilisateur inclut : Déclaration de paramètres provenant d'autres endroits différents comme : en-têtes . , cookies , champs de formulaire et fichiers . L'utilisation de contraintes de validation comme maximum_length ou regex . Un système d'injection de dépendance très puissant et facile à utiliser . Sécurité et authentification, y compris la prise en charge de OAuth2 avec les jetons JWT et l'authentification HTTP Basic . Des techniques plus avancées (mais tout aussi faciles) pour déclarer les modèles JSON profondément imbriqués (grâce à Pydantic). Intégration de GraphQL avec Strawberry et d'autres bibliothèques. D'obtenir de nombreuses fonctionnalités supplémentaires (grâce à  Starlette) comme : WebSockets de tester le code très facilement avec requests et pytest CORS Cookie Sessions ... et plus encore. Performance Les benchmarks TechEmpower indépendants montrent que les applications FastAPI s'exécutant sous Uvicorn sont parmi les frameworks existants en Python les plus rapides , juste derrière Starlette et Uvicorn (utilisés en interne par FastAPI). (*) Pour en savoir plus, consultez la section Benchmarks . Dépendances facultatives Utilisées par Pydantic: Utilisées par Starlette : requests - Obligatoire si vous souhaitez utiliser TestClient . jinja2 - Obligatoire si vous souhaitez utiliser la configuration de template par défaut. python-multipart - Obligatoire si vous souhaitez supporter le \"décodage\" de formulaire avec request.form() . itsdangerous - Obligatoire pour la prise en charge de SessionMiddleware . pyyaml - Obligatoire pour le support SchemaGenerator de Starlette (vous n'en avez probablement pas besoin avec FastAPI). Utilisées par FastAPI / Starlette : uvicorn - Pour le serveur qui charge et sert votre application. orjson - Obligatoire si vous voulez utiliser ORJSONResponse . ujson - Obligatoire si vous souhaitez utiliser UJSONResponse .

Typer é o irmão menor do FastAPI. E seu propósito é ser o FastAPI das CLIs . ⌨️ 🚀 Requisitos FastAPI está nos ombros de gigantes: Instalação Crie e ative um ambiente virtual , e então instale o FastAPI: $ pip install \"fastapi[standard]\" ---> 100% Nota : Certifique-se de que você colocou \"fastapi[standard]\" com aspas, para garantir que funcione em todos os terminais. Exemplo Crie Crie um arquivo main.py com: from typing import Union from fastapi import FastAPI app = FastAPI () @app . get ( \"/\" ) def read_root (): return { \"Hello\" : \"World\" } @app . get ( \"/items/ {item_id} \" ) def read_item ( item_id : int , q : Union [ str , None ] = None ): return { \"item_id\" : item_id , \"q\" : q } Ou use async def ...

INFO:     Application startup complete. Sobre o comando fastapi dev main.py ... O comando fastapi dev lê o seu arquivo main.py , identifica o aplicativo FastAPI nele, e inicia um servidor usando o Uvicorn . Por padrão, o fastapi dev iniciará com auto-reload habilitado para desenvolvimento local. Você pode ler mais sobre isso na documentação do FastAPI CLI . Verifique Abra seu navegador em http://127.0.0.1:8000/items/5?q=somequery . Você verá a resposta JSON como: { \"item_id\" : 5 , \"q\" : \"somequery\" } Você acabou de criar uma API que: Recebe requisições HTTP nas rotas / e /items/{item_id} . Ambas rotas fazem operações GET (também conhecido como métodos HTTP). A rota /items/{item_id} tem um parâmetro de rota item_id que deve ser um int . A rota /items/{item_id} tem um parâmetro query q str opcional. Documentação Interativa da API Agora vá para http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs . Você verá a documentação automática interativa da API (fornecida por Swagger UI ): Documentação Alternativa da API E agora, vá para http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc . Você verá a documentação automática alternativa (fornecida por ReDoc ): Evoluindo o Exemplo Agora modifique o arquivo main.py para receber um corpo para uma requisição PUT . Declare o corpo utilizando tipos padrão Python, graças ao Pydantic. from typing import Union from fastapi import FastAPI from pydantic import BaseModel app = FastAPI () class Item ( BaseModel ): name : str price : float is_offer : Union [ bool , None ] = None @app . get ( \"/\" ) def read_root (): return { \"Hello\" : \"World\" } @app . get ( \"/items/ {item_id} \" ) def read_item ( item_id : int , q : Union [ str , None ] = None ): return { \"item_id\" : item_id , \"q\" : q } @app . put ( \"/items/ {item_id} \" ) def update_item ( item_id : int , item : Item ): return { \"item_name\" : item . name , \"item_id\" : item_id } O servidor fastapi dev deverá recarregar automaticamente. Evoluindo a Documentação Interativa da API Agora vá para http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs . A documentação interativa da API será automaticamente atualizada, incluindo o novo corpo: Clique no botão \"Try it out\", ele permitirá que você preencha os parâmetros e interaja diretamente com a API: Então clique no botão \"Execute\", a interface do usuário irá se comunicar com a API, enviar os parâmetros, pegar os resultados e mostrá-los na tela: Evoluindo a Documentação Alternativa da API E agora, vá para http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc . A documentação alternativa também irá refletir o novo parâmetro da query e o corpo: Recapitulando Resumindo, você declara uma vez os tipos dos parâmetros, corpo etc. como parâmetros de função. Você faz isso com os tipos padrão do Python moderno. Você não terá que aprender uma nova sintaxe, métodos ou classes de uma biblioteca específica etc. Apenas Python padrão. Por exemplo, para um int : ou para um modelo mais complexo, Item : ...e com essa única declaração você tem: Suporte ao Editor, incluindo: Completação. Verificação de tipos. Validação de dados: Erros automáticos e claros quando o dado é inválido. Validação até para objetos JSON profundamente aninhados. Conversão de dados de entrada: vindo da rede para dados e tipos Python. Consegue ler: JSON. Parâmetros de rota. Parâmetros de query . Cookies . Cabeçalhos. Formulários. Arquivos. Conversão de dados de saída de tipos e dados Python para dados de rede (como JSON): Converte tipos Python ( str , int , float , bool , list etc). Objetos datetime . Objetos UUID . Modelos de Banco de Dados. ...e muito mais. Documentação interativa automática da API, incluindo 2 alternativas de interface de usuário: Voltando ao código do exemplo anterior, FastAPI irá: Validar que existe um item_id na rota para requisições GET e PUT . Validar que item_id é do tipo int para requisições GET e PUT . Se não é validado, o cliente verá um útil, claro erro. Verificar se existe um parâmetro de query opcional nomeado como q (como em http://127.0.0.1:8000/items/foo?q=somequery ) para requisições GET . Como o parâmetro q é declarado com = None , ele é opcional. Sem o None ele poderia ser obrigatório (como o corpo no caso de PUT ). Para requisições PUT para /items/{item_id} , lerá o corpo como JSON e: Verifica que tem um atributo obrigatório name que deve ser str . Verifica que tem um atributo obrigatório price que deve ser float . Verifica que tem an atributo opcional is_offer , que deve ser bool , se presente. Tudo isso também funciona para objetos JSON profundamente aninhados. Converter de e para JSON automaticamente. Documentar tudo com OpenAPI, que poderá ser usado por: Sistemas de documentação interativos. Sistemas de clientes de geração de código automáticos, para muitas linguagens. Fornecer diretamente 2 interfaces web de documentação interativa. Nós apenas arranhamos a superfície, mas você já tem idéia de como tudo funciona. Experimente mudar a seguinte linha: return { \"item_name\" : item . name , \"item_id\" : item_id } ...de: ... \"item_name\" : item . name ... ...para: ... \"item_price\" : item . price ... ...e veja como seu editor irá auto-completar os atributos e saberá os tipos: Para um exemplo mais completo incluindo mais recursos, veja Tutorial - Guia do Usuário . Alerta de Spoiler : o tutorial - guia do usuário inclui: Declaração de parâmetetros de diferentes lugares como: cabeçalhos , cookies , campos de formulários e arquivos . Como configurar Limitações de Validação como maximum_length ou regex . Um poderoso e fácil de usar sistema de Injeção de Dependência . Segurança e autenticação, incluindo suporte para OAuth2 com autenticação JWT tokens e HTTP Basic . Técnicas mais avançadas (mas igualmente fáceis) para declaração de modelos JSON profundamente aninhados (graças ao Pydantic). Integrações GraphQL com o Strawberry e outras bibliotecas. Muitos recursos extras (graças ao Starlette) como: WebSockets testes extrememamente fáceis baseados em HTTPX e pytest CORS Cookie Sessions ...e mais. Performance Testes de performance da Independent TechEmpower mostram aplicações FastAPI rodando sob Uvicorn como um dos frameworks Python mais rápidos disponíveis , somente atrás de Starlette e Uvicorn (utilizados internamente pelo FastAPI). (*) Para entender mais sobre performance, veja a seção Comparações . Dependências O FastAPI depende do Pydantic e do Starlette. Dependências standard Quando você instala o FastAPI com pip install \"fastapi[standard]\" , ele vêm com o grupo standard (padrão) de dependências opcionais: Utilizado pelo Pydantic: Utilizado pelo Starlette: httpx - Obrigatório caso você queira utilizar o TestClient . jinja2 - Obrigatório se você quer utilizar a configuração padrão de templates. python-multipart - Obrigatório se você deseja suporte a \"parsing\" de formulário, com request.form() . Utilizado pelo FastAPI / Starlette: uvicorn - para o servidor que carrega e serve a sua aplicação. Isto inclui uvicorn[standard] , que inclui algumas dependências (e.g. uvloop ) necessárias para servir em alta performance. fastapi-cli - que disponibiliza o comando fastapi . Sem as dependências standard Se você não deseja incluir as dependências opcionais standard , você pode instalar utilizando pip install fastapi ao invés de pip install \"fastapi[standard]\" . Dpendências opcionais adicionais Existem algumas dependências adicionais que você pode querer instalar. Dependências opcionais adicionais do Pydantic: Dependências opcionais adicionais do FastAPI: orjson - Obrigatório se você deseja utilizar o ORJSONResponse . ujson - Obrigatório se você deseja utilizar o UJSONResponse .

По умолчанию fastapi dev запускается с включённой авто-перезагрузкой для локальной разработки. Подробнее в документации по FastAPI CLI . Проверка Откройте браузер на http://127.0.0.1:8000/items/5?q=somequery . Вы увидите JSON-ответ: { \"item_id\" : 5 , \"q\" : \"somequery\" } Вы уже создали API, который: Получает HTTP-запросы по путям / и /items/{item_id} . Оба пути используют GET операции (также известные как HTTP методы ). Путь /items/{item_id} имеет параметр пути item_id , который должен быть int . Путь /items/{item_id} имеет необязательный str параметр запроса q . Интерактивная документация API Перейдите на http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs . Вы увидите автоматическую интерактивную документацию API (предоставлена Swagger UI ): Альтернативная документация API Теперь откройте http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc . Вы увидите альтернативную автоматическую документацию (предоставлена ReDoc ): Пример обновления Теперь измените файл main.py , чтобы принимать тело запроса из PUT запроса. Объявите тело, используя стандартные типы Python, спасибо Pydantic. from typing import Union from fastapi import FastAPI from pydantic import BaseModel app = FastAPI () class Item ( BaseModel ): name : str price : float is_offer : Union [ bool , None ] = None @app . get ( \"/\" ) def read_root (): return { \"Hello\" : \"World\" } @app . get ( \"/items/ {item_id} \" ) def read_item ( item_id : int , q : Union [ str , None ] = None ): return { \"item_id\" : item_id , \"q\" : q } @app . put ( \"/items/ {item_id} \" ) def update_item ( item_id : int , item : Item ): return { \"item_name\" : item . name , \"item_id\" : item_id } Сервер fastapi dev должен перезагрузиться автоматически. Обновление интерактивной документации API Перейдите на http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs . Интерактивная документация API будет автоматически обновлена, включая новое тело: Нажмите кнопку «Try it out», это позволит вам заполнить параметры и напрямую взаимодействовать с API: Затем нажмите кнопку «Execute», интерфейс свяжется с вашим API, отправит параметры, получит результаты и отобразит их на экране: Обновление альтернативной документации API Теперь откройте http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc . Альтернативная документация также отразит новый параметр запроса и тело: Подведём итоги Итак, вы объявляете один раз типы параметров, тела запроса и т.д. как параметры функции. Вы делаете это с помощью стандартных современных типов Python. Вам не нужно изучать новый синтаксис, методы или классы конкретной библиотеки и т.п. Только стандартный Python . Например, для int : или для более сложной модели Item : ...и с этим единственным объявлением вы получаете: Поддержку редактора кода, включая: Автозавершение. Проверку типов. Валидацию данных: Автоматические и понятные ошибки, когда данные некорректны. Валидацию даже для глубоко вложенных объектов JSON. Преобразование входных данных: из сети в данные и типы Python. Чтение из: JSON. Параметров пути. Параметров запроса. Cookies. HTTP-заголовков. Форм. Файлов. Преобразование выходных данных: из данных и типов Python в данные сети (например, JSON): Преобразование типов Python ( str , int , float , bool , list и т.д.). Объекты datetime . Объекты UUID . Модели баз данных. ...и многое другое. Автоматическую интерактивную документацию API, включая 2 альтернативных интерфейса: Возвращаясь к предыдущему примеру кода, FastAPI будет: Валидировать наличие item_id в пути для GET и PUT запросов. Валидировать, что item_id имеет тип int для GET и PUT запросов. Если это не так, клиент увидит полезную понятную ошибку. Проверять, есть ли необязательный параметр запроса с именем q (например, http://127.0.0.1:8000/items/foo?q=somequery ) для GET запросов. Поскольку параметр q объявлен с = None , он необязателен. Без None он был бы обязательным (как тело запроса в случае с PUT ). Для PUT запросов к /items/{item_id} читать тело запроса как JSON: Проверять, что есть обязательный атрибут name , который должен быть str . Проверять, что есть обязательный атрибут price , который должен быть float . Проверять, что есть необязательный атрибут is_offer , который должен быть bool , если он присутствует. Всё это также будет работать для глубоко вложенных объектов JSON. Автоматически преобразовывать из и в JSON. Документировать всё с помощью OpenAPI, что может быть использовано: Системами интерактивной документации. Системами автоматической генерации клиентского кода для многих языков. Предоставлять 2 веб-интерфейса интерактивной документации напрямую. Мы только поверхностно ознакомились, но вы уже понимаете, как всё это работает. Попробуйте изменить строку: return { \"item_name\" : item . name , \"item_id\" : item_id } ...из: ... \"item_name\" : item . name ... ...на: ... \"item_price\" : item . price ... ...и посмотрите, как ваш редактор кода будет автоматически дополнять атрибуты и знать их типы: Более полный пример с дополнительными возможностями см. в Учебник - Руководство пользователя . Осторожно, спойлер : учебник - руководство включает: Объявление параметров из других источников: HTTP-заголовки , cookies , поля формы и файлы . Как задать ограничения валидации вроде maximum_length или regex . Очень мощную и простую в использовании систему внедрения зависимостей . Безопасность и аутентификацию, включая поддержку OAuth2 с JWT токенами и HTTP Basic аутентификацию. Более продвинутые (но столь же простые) приёмы объявления глубоко вложенных JSON-моделей (спасибо Pydantic). Интеграцию GraphQL с Strawberry и другими библиотеками. Множество дополнительных функций (благодаря Starlette), таких как: WebSockets чрезвычайно простые тесты на основе HTTPX и pytest CORS сессии с использованием cookie ...и многое другое. Производительность Независимые бенчмарки TechEmpower показывают приложения FastAPI , работающие под управлением Uvicorn, как один из самых быстрых доступных фреймворков Python , уступающий только самим Starlette и Uvicorn (используются внутри FastAPI). (*) Чтобы узнать больше, см. раздел Бенчмарки . Зависимости FastAPI зависит от Pydantic и Starlette. Зависимости standard Когда вы устанавливаете FastAPI с помощью pip install \"fastapi[standard]\" , он идёт с группой опциональных зависимостей standard : Используется Pydantic: Используется Starlette: httpx — обязателен, если вы хотите использовать TestClient . jinja2 — обязателен, если вы хотите использовать конфигурацию шаблонов по умолчанию. python-multipart — обязателен, если вы хотите поддерживать «парсинг» форм через request.form() . Используется FastAPI: uvicorn — сервер, который загружает и обслуживает ваше приложение. Включает uvicorn[standard] , содержащий некоторые зависимости (например, uvloop ), нужные для высокой производительности. fastapi-cli[standard] — чтобы предоставить команду fastapi . Включает fastapi-cloud-cli , который позволяет развернуть ваше приложение FastAPI в FastAPI Cloud . Без зависимостей standard Если вы не хотите включать опциональные зависимости standard , можно установить pip install fastapi вместо pip install \"fastapi[standard]\" . Без fastapi-cloud-cli Если вы хотите установить FastAPI со стандартными зависимостями, но без fastapi-cloud-cli , установите pip install \"fastapi[standard-no-fastapi-cloud-cli]\" . Дополнительные опциональные зависимости Есть дополнительные зависимости, которые вы можете установить. Дополнительные опциональные зависимости Pydantic: Дополнительные опциональные зависимости FastAPI: orjson — обязателен, если вы хотите использовать ORJSONResponse . ujson — обязателен, если вы хотите использовать UJSONResponse .

Eğer kodunuzda async / await varsa, async def kullanalım: from typing import Union from fastapi import FastAPI app = FastAPI () @app . get ( \"/\" ) async def read_root (): return { \"Hello\" : \"World\" } @app . get ( \"/items/ {item_id} \" ) async def read_item ( item_id : int , q : Union [ str , None ] = None ): return { \"item_id\" : item_id , \"q\" : q } Not : Eğer bu konu hakkında bilginiz yoksa async ve await dokümantasyonundaki \"Aceleniz mi var?\" kısmını kontrol edebilirsiniz. Kodu Çalıştıralım Sunucuyu aşağıdaki komutla çalıştıralım: $ uvicorn main:app --reload INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit) INFO:     Started reloader process [28720] INFO:     Started server process [28722] INFO:     Waiting for application startup. INFO:     Application startup complete. uvicorn main:app --reload komutuyla ilgili... uvicorn main:app komutunu şu şekilde açıklayabiliriz: main : dosya olan main.py (yani Python \"modülü\"). app : ise main.py dosyasının içerisinde app = FastAPI() satırında oluşturduğumuz FastAPI nesnesi. --reload : kod değişikliklerinin ardından sunucuyu otomatik olarak yeniden başlatır. Bu parameteyi sadece geliştirme aşamasında kullanmalıyız. Şimdi de Kontrol Edelim Tarayıcımızda şu bağlantıyı açalım http://127.0.0.1:8000/items/5?q=somequery . Aşağıdaki gibi bir JSON yanıtıyla karşılaşacağız: { \"item_id\" : 5 , \"q\" : \"somequery\" } Az önce oluşturduğumuz API: / ve /items/{item_id} yollarına HTTP isteği alabilir. İki yolda GET operasyonlarını (HTTP metodları olarak da bilinen) kabul ediyor. /items/{item_id} yolu item_id adında bir yol parametresine sahip ve bu parametre int değer almak zorundadır. /items/{item_id} yolu q adında bir yol parametresine sahip ve bu parametre opsiyonel olmakla birlikte, str değer almak zorundadır. Etkileşimli API Dokümantasyonu Şimdi http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs bağlantısını açalım. Swagger UI tarafından sağlanan otomatik etkileşimli bir API dokümantasyonu göreceğiz: Alternatif API Dokümantasyonu Şimdi http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc bağlantısını açalım. ReDoc tarafından sağlanan otomatik dokümantasyonu göreceğiz: Örneği Güncelleyelim Şimdi main.py dosyasını, PUT isteğiyle birlikte bir gövde alacak şekilde değiştirelim. Gövde yi Pydantic sayesinde standart python tiplerini kullanarak tanımlayalım. from typing import Union from fastapi import FastAPI from pydantic import BaseModel app = FastAPI () class Item ( BaseModel ): name : str price : float is_offer : Union [ bool , None ] = None @app . get ( \"/\" ) def read_root (): return { \"Hello\" : \"World\" } @app . get ( \"/items/ {item_id} \" ) def read_item ( item_id : int , q : Union [ str , None ] = None ): return { \"item_id\" : item_id , \"q\" : q } @app . put ( \"/items/ {item_id} \" ) def update_item ( item_id : int , item : Item ): return { \"item_name\" : item . name , \"item_id\" : item_id } Sunucu otomatik olarak yeniden başlamış olmalı (çünkü yukarıda uvicorn komutuyla birlikte --reload parametresini kullandık). Etkileşimli API Dokümantasyonundaki Değişimi Görelim Şimdi http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs bağlantısına tekrar gidelim. Etkileşimli API dokümantasyonu, yeni gövdede dahil olmak üzere otomatik olarak güncellenmiş olacak: \"Try it out\" butonuna tıklayalım, bu işlem API parametleri üzerinde değişiklik yapmamıza ve doğrudan API ile etkileşime geçmemize imkan sağlayacak: Şimdi \"Execute\" butonuna tıklayalım, kullanıcı arayüzü API'ımız ile bağlantı kurup parametreleri gönderecek ve sonucu ekranımıza getirecek: Alternatif API Dokümantasyonundaki Değişimi Görelim Şimdi ise http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc bağlantısına tekrar gidelim. Alternatif dokümantasyonda yaptığımız değişiklikler ile birlikte yeni sorgu parametresi ve gövde bilgisi ile güncelemiş olacak: Özet Özetlemek gerekirse, parametrelerin, gövdenin, vb. veri tiplerini fonksiyon parametreleri olarak bir kere tanımlıyoruz. Bu işlemi standart modern Python tipleriyle yapıyoruz. Yeni bir sözdizimi yapısını, bir kütüphane özel metod veya sınıfları öğrenmeye gerek yoktur. Hepsi sadece Python standartlarına dayalıdır. Örnek olarak, int tanımlamak için: ya da daha kompleks herhangi bir python modelini tanımlayabiliriz, örneğin Item modeli için: ...ve sadece kısa bir parametre tipi belirterek elde ettiklerimiz: Editör desteğiyle birlikte: Otomatik tamamlama. Tip kontrolü. Veri Doğrulama: Veri geçerli değilse, otomatik olarak açıklayıcı hatalar gösterir. Çok derin JSON nesnelerinde bile doğrulama yapar. Gelen verinin dönüşümünü aşağıdaki veri tiplerini kullanarak gerçekleştirir: JSON. Yol parametreleri. Sorgu parametreleri. Çerezler. Headers. Formlar. Dosyalar. Giden verinin dönüşümünü aşağıdaki veri tiplerini kullanarak gerçekleştirir (JSON olarak): Python tiplerinin ( str , int , float , bool , list , vb) dönüşümü. datetime nesnesi. UUID nesnesi. Veritabanı modelleri. ve çok daha fazlası... 2 alternatif kullanıcı arayüzü dahil olmak üzere, otomatik etkileşimli API dokümantasyonu sağlar: Az önceki örneğe geri dönelim, FastAPI 'ın yapacaklarına bir bakış atalım: item_id 'nin GET ve PUT istekleri için, yolda olup olmadığının kontol edecek. item_id 'nin GET ve PUT istekleri için, tipinin int olduğunu doğrulayacak. Eğer değilse, sebebini belirten bir hata mesajı gösterecek. Opsiyonel bir q parametresinin GET isteği içinde ( http://127.0.0.1:8000/items/foo?q=somequery gibi) olup olmadığını kontrol edecek q parametresini = None ile oluşturduğumuz için, opsiyonel bir parametre olacak. Eğer None olmasa zorunlu bir parametre olacaktı ( PUT metodunun gövdesinde olduğu gibi). PUT isteği için /items/{item_id} 'nin gövdesini, JSON olarak doğrulayıp okuyacak: name adında zorunlu bir parametre olup olmadığını ve varsa tipinin str olup olmadığını kontol edecek. price adında zorunlu bir parametre olup olmadığını ve varsa tipinin float olup olmadığını kontol edecek. is_offer adında opsiyonel bir parametre olup olmadığını ve varsa tipinin float olup olmadığını kontol edecek. Bunların hepsi en derin JSON nesnelerinde bile çalışacak. Verilerin JSON'a ve JSON'ın python nesnesine dönüşümü otomatik olarak yapılacak. Her şeyi OpenAPI ile uyumlu bir şekilde otomatik olarak dokümanlayacak ve bunlarda aşağıdaki gibi kullanılabilecek: Etkileşimli dokümantasyon sistemleri. Bir çok programlama dili için otomatik istemci kodu üretim sistemleri. İki ayrı etkileşimli dokümantasyon arayüzünü doğrudan sağlayacak. Daha yeni başladık ama çalışma mantığını çoktan anlamış oldunuz. Şimdi aşağıdaki satırı değiştirmeyi deneyin: return { \"item_name\" : item . name , \"item_id\" : item_id } ...bundan: ... \"item_name\" : item . name ... ...buna: ... \"item_price\" : item . price ... ...ve editörünün veri tiplerini bildiğini ve otomatik tamamladığını göreceksiniz: Daha fazal özellik içeren, daha eksiksiz bir örnek için Öğretici - Kullanıcı Rehberi sayfasını ziyaret edebilirsin. Spoiler : Öğretici - Kullanıcı rehberi şunları içerir: Parameterlerin , headers , çerezler , form alanları ve dosyalar olarak tanımlanması. maximum_length ya da regex gibi doğrulama kısıtlamalarının nasıl yapılabileceği. Çok güçlü ve kullanımı kolay Bağımlılık Enjeksiyonu sistemi oluşturmayı. Güvenlik ve kimlik doğrulama, JWT tokenleri ile OAuth2 desteği, ve HTTP Basic doğrulaması. İleri seviye fakat bir o kadarda basit olan çok derin JSON modelleri (Pydantic sayesinde). GraphQL entegrasyonu: Strawberry ve diğer kütüphaneleri kullanarak. Diğer ekstra özellikler (Starlette sayesinde): WebSocketler HTTPX ve pytest sayesinde aşırı kolay testler. CORS Cookie Sessions ...ve daha fazlası. Performans Bağımsız TechEmpower kıyaslamaları gösteriyor ki, Uvicorn ile çalıştırılan FastAPI uygulamaları en hızlı Python framework'lerinden birisi , sadece Starlette ve Uvicorn'dan yavaş, ki FastAPI bunların üzerine kurulu bir kütüphanedir. Daha fazla bilgi için, bu bölüme bir göz at Kıyaslamalar . Opsiyonel Gereksinimler Pydantic tarafında kullanılan: Starlette tarafında kullanılan: httpx - Eğer TestClient yapısını kullanacaksanız gereklidir. jinja2 - Eğer varsayılan template konfigürasyonunu kullanacaksanız gereklidir. python-multipart - Eğer request.form() ile form dönüşümü desteğini kullanacaksanız gereklidir. itsdangerous - SessionMiddleware desteği için gerekli. pyyaml - SchemaGenerator desteği için gerekli (Muhtemelen FastAPI kullanırken ihtiyacınız olmaz). Hem FastAPI hem de Starlette tarafından kullanılan: uvicorn - oluşturduğumuz uygulamayı servis edecek web sunucusu görevini üstlenir. orjson - ORJSONResponse kullanacaksanız gereklidir. ujson - UJSONResponse kullanacaksanız gerekli.

Оновлення інтерактивної API документації Тепер перейдемо сюди http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs . Інтерактивна документація API буде автоматично оновлена, включаючи новий вміст: Натисніть кнопку \"Try it out\", це дозволить вам заповнити параметри та безпосередньо взаємодіяти з API: Потім натисніть кнопку \"Execute\", інтерфейс користувача зв'яжеться з вашим API, надішле параметри, у відповідь отримає результати та покаже їх на екрані: Оновлення альтернативної API документації Зараз перейдемо http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc . Альтернативна документація також показуватиме новий параметр і вміст запиту: Підсумки Таким чином, Ви один раз оголошуєте типи параметрів, тіла тощо, як параметри функції. Ви робите це за допомогою стандартних сучасних типів Python. Вам не потрібно вивчати новий синтаксис, методи чи класи конкретної бібліотеки тощо. Використовуючи стандартний Python . Наприклад, для int : або для більш складної моделі Item : ...і з цим єдиним оголошенням Ви отримуєте: Підтримку редактора, включаючи: Варіанти заповнення. Перевірку типів. Перевірку даних: Автоматичні та зрозумілі помилки, у разі некоректних даних. Перевірка навіть для JSON з високим рівнем вкладеності. Перетворення вхідних даних: з мережі до даних і типів Python. Читання з: JSON. Параметрів шляху. Параметрів запиту. Cookies. Headers. Forms. Файлів. Перетворення вихідних даних: з типів і даних Python до мережевих даних (як JSON): Конвертація Python типів ( str , int , float , bool , list , тощо). datetime об'єкти. UUID об'єкти. Моделі бази даних. ...та багато іншого. Автоматичну інтерактивну документацію API, включаючи 2 альтернативні інтерфейси користувача: Повертаючись до попереднього прикладу коду, FastAPI : Підтвердить наявність item_id у шляху для запитів GET та PUT . Підтвердить, що item_id має тип int для запитів GET and PUT . Якщо це не так, клієнт побачить корисну, зрозумілу помилку. Перевірить, чи є необов'язковий параметр запиту з назвою q (а саме http://127.0.0.1:8000/items/foo?q=somequery ) для запитів GET . Оскільки параметр q оголошено як = None , він необов'язковий. За відсутності None він був би обов'язковим (як і вміст у випадку з PUT ). Для запитів PUT із /items/{item_id} , читає вміст як JSON: Перевірить, чи має обов'язковий атрибут name тип str . Перевірить, чи має обов'язковий атрибут price тип float . Перевірить, чи існує необов'язковий атрибут is_offer та чи має він тип bool . Усе це також працюватиме для глибоко вкладених об'єктів JSON. Автоматично конвертує із та в JSON. Документує все за допомогою OpenAPI, який може бути використано в: Інтерактивних системах документації. Системах автоматичної генерації клієнтського коду для багатьох мов. Надає безпосередньо 2 вебінтерфейси інтерактивної документації. Ми лише трішки доторкнулися до коду, але Ви вже маєте уявлення про те, як все працює. Спробуйте змінити рядок: return { \"item_name\" : item . name , \"item_id\" : item_id } ...із: ... \"item_name\" : item . name ... ...на: ... \"item_price\" : item . price ... ...і побачите, як ваш редактор автоматично заповнюватиме атрибути та знатиме їхні типи: Для більш повного ознайомлення з додатковими функціями, перегляньте Туторіал - Посібник Користувача . Spoiler alert : туторіал - посібник користувача містить: Оголошення параметрів з інших місць як: headers , cookies , form fields та files . Як встановити перевірку обмежень як maximum_length або regex . Дуже потужна і проста у використанні система Ін'єкція Залежностей . Безпека та автентифікація, включаючи підтримку OAuth2 з JWT tokens та HTTP Basic автентифікацію. Досконаліші (але однаково прості) техніки для оголошення глибоко вкладених моделей JSON (завдяки Pydantic). Багато додаткових функцій (завдяки Starlette) як-от: WebSockets надзвичайно прості тести на основі HTTPX та pytest CORS Cookie Sessions ...та більше. Продуктивність Незалежні тести TechEmpower показують що застосунки FastAPI , які працюють під керуванням Uvicorn є одними з найшвидших серед доступних фреймворків в Python , поступаючись лише Starlette та Uvicorn (які внутрішньо використовуються в FastAPI). (*) Щоб дізнатися більше про це, перегляньте розділ Benchmarks . Необов'язкові залежності Pydantic використовує: Starlette використовує: httpx - Необхідно, якщо Ви хочете використовувати TestClient . jinja2 - Необхідно, якщо Ви хочете використовувати шаблони як конфігурацію за замовчуванням. python-multipart - Необхідно, якщо Ви хочете підтримувати \"розбір\" форми за допомогою request.form() . itsdangerous - Необхідно для підтримки SessionMiddleware . pyyaml - Необхідно для підтримки Starlette SchemaGenerator (ймовірно, вам це не потрібно з FastAPI). FastAPI / Starlette використовують: uvicorn - для сервера, який завантажує та обслуговує вашу програму. orjson - Необхідно, якщо Ви хочете використовувати ORJSONResponse . ujson - Необхідно, якщо Ви хочете використовувати UJSONResponse .

Nếu code của bạn sử dụng async / await , hãy sử dụng async def : from typing import Union from fastapi import FastAPI app = FastAPI () @app . get ( \"/\" ) async def read_root (): return { \"Hello\" : \"World\" } @app . get ( \"/items/ {item_id} \" ) async def read_item ( item_id : int , q : Union [ str , None ] = None ): return { \"item_id\" : item_id , \"q\" : q } Lưu ý : Nếu bạn không biết, xem phần \"In a hurry?\" về async và await trong tài liệu này . Chạy ứng dụng Chạy server như sau: $ uvicorn main:app --reload INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit) INFO:     Started reloader process [28720] INFO:     Started server process [28722] INFO:     Waiting for application startup. INFO:     Application startup complete. Về lệnh uvicorn main:app --reload ... Lệnh uvicorn main:app tham chiếu tới những thành phần sau: main : tệp tin main.py (một Python \"module\"). app : object được tạo trong tệp tin main.py tại dòng app = FastAPI() . --reload : chạy lại server sau khi code thay đổi. Chỉ sử dụng trong quá trình phát triển. Kiểm tra Mở trình duyệt của bạn tại http://127.0.0.1:8000/items/5?q=somequery . Bạn sẽ thấy một JSON response: { \"item_id\" : 5 , \"q\" : \"somequery\" } Bạn đã sẵn sàng để tạo một API như sau: Nhận HTTP request với đường dẫn / và /items/{item_id} . Cả hai đường dẫn sử dụng toán tử GET (cũng đươc biết đến là phương thức HTTP). Đường dẫn /items/{item_id} có một tham số đường dẫn item_id , nó là một tham số kiểu int . Đường dẫn /items/{item_id} có một tham số query string q , nó là một tham số tùy chọn kiểu str . Tài liệu tương tác API Truy cập http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs . Bạn sẽ thấy tài liệu tương tác API được tạo tự động (cung cấp bởi Swagger UI ): Tài liệu API thay thế Và bây giờ, hãy truy cập tới http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc . Bạn sẽ thấy tài liệu được thay thế (cung cấp bởi ReDoc ): Nâng cấp ví dụ Bây giờ sửa tệp tin main.py để nhận body từ một request PUT . Định nghĩa của body sử dụng kiểu dữ liệu chuẩn của Python, cảm ơn Pydantic. from typing import Union from fastapi import FastAPI from pydantic import BaseModel app = FastAPI () class Item ( BaseModel ): name : str price : float is_offer : Union [ bool , None ] = None @app . get ( \"/\" ) def read_root (): return { \"Hello\" : \"World\" } @app . get ( \"/items/ {item_id} \" ) def read_item ( item_id : int , q : Union [ str , None ] = None ): return { \"item_id\" : item_id , \"q\" : q } @app . put ( \"/items/ {item_id} \" ) def update_item ( item_id : int , item : Item ): return { \"item_name\" : item . name , \"item_id\" : item_id } Server nên tự động chạy lại (bởi vì bạn đã thêm --reload trong lệnh uvicorn ở trên). Nâng cấp tài liệu API Bây giờ truy cập tới http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs . Tài liệu API sẽ được tự động cập nhật, bao gồm body mới: Click vào nút \"Try it out\", nó cho phép bạn điền những tham số và tương tác trực tiếp với API: Sau khi click vào nút \"Execute\", giao diện người dùng sẽ giao tiếp với API của bạn bao gồm: gửi các tham số, lấy kết quả và hiển thị chúng trên màn hình: Nâng cấp tài liệu API thay thế Và bây giờ truy cập tới http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc . Tài liệu thay thế cũng sẽ phản ánh tham số và body mới: Tóm lại Bạn khai báo một lần kiểu dữ liệu của các tham số, body, etc là các tham số của hàm số. Bạn định nghĩa bằng cách sử dụng các kiểu dữ liệu chuẩn của Python. Bạn không phải học một cú pháp mới, các phương thức và class của một thư viện cụ thể nào. Chỉ cần sử dụng các chuẩn của Python . Ví dụ, với một tham số kiểu int : hoặc với một model Item phức tạp hơn: ...và với định nghĩa đơn giản đó, bạn có được: Sự hỗ trợ từ các trình soạn thảo, bao gồm: Completion. Kiểm tra kiểu dữ liệu. Kiểm tra kiểu dữ liệu: Tự động sinh lỗi rõ ràng khi dữ liệu không hợp lệ . Kiểm tra JSON lồng nhau . Chuyển đổi dữ liệu đầu vào: tới từ network sang dữ liệu kiểu Python. Đọc từ: JSON. Các tham số trong đường dẫn. Các tham số trong query string. Cookies. Headers. Forms. Files. Chuyển đổi dữ liệu đầu ra: chuyển đổi từ kiểu dữ liệu Python sang dữ liệu network (như JSON): Chuyển đổi kiểu dữ liệu Python ( str , int , float , bool , list ,...). datetime objects. UUID objects. Database models. ...và nhiều hơn thế. Tự động tạo tài liệu tương tác API, bao gồm 2 giao diện người dùng: Quay trở lại ví dụ trước, FastAPI sẽ thực hiện: Chúng tôi chỉ trình bày những thứ cơ bản bên ngoài, nhưng bạn đã hiểu cách thức hoạt động của nó. Thử thay đổi dòng này: return { \"item_name\" : item . name , \"item_id\" : item_id } ...từ: ... \"item_name\" : item . name ... ...sang: ... \"item_price\" : item . price ... ...và thấy trình soạn thảo của bạn nhận biết kiểu dữ liệu và gợi ý hoàn thiện các thuộc tính. Ví dụ hoàn chỉnh bao gồm nhiều tính năng hơn, xem Tutorial - User Guide . Cảnh báo tiết lỗ : Tutorial - User Guide: Định nghĩa tham số từ các nguồn khác nhau như: headers , cookies , form fields và files . Cách thiết lập các ràng buộc cho validation như maximum_length hoặc regex . Một hệ thống ** Dependency Injection vô cùng mạnh mẽ và dễ dàng sử dụng. Bảo mật và xác thực, hỗ trợ OAuth2 (với JWT tokens ) và HTTP Basic . Những kĩ thuật nâng cao hơn (nhưng tương đối dễ) để định nghĩa JSON models lồng nhau (cảm ơn Pydantic). Tích hợp GraphQL với Strawberry và các thư viện khác. Nhiều tính năng mở rộng (cảm ơn Starlette) như: WebSockets kiểm thử vô cùng dễ dàng dựa trên HTTPX và pytest CORS Cookie Sessions ...và nhiều hơn thế. Hiệu năng Independent TechEmpower benchmarks cho thấy các ứng dụng FastAPI chạy dưới Uvicorn là một trong những Python framework nhanh nhất , chỉ đứng sau Starlette và Uvicorn (được sử dụng bên trong FastAPI).

INFO:     Application startup complete. 关于 uvicorn main:app --reload 命令...... uvicorn main:app 命令含义如下: main ： main.py 文件（一个 Python \"模块\"）。 app ：在 main.py 文件中通过 app = FastAPI() 创建的对象。 --reload ：让服务器在更新代码后重新启动。仅在开发时使用该选项。 检查 使用浏览器访问 http://127.0.0.1:8000/items/5?q=somequery 。 你将会看到如下 JSON 响应： { \"item_id\" : 5 , \"q\" : \"somequery\" } 你已经创建了一个具有以下功能的 API： 通过 路径 / 和 /items/{item_id} 接受 HTTP 请求。 以上 路径 都接受 GET 操作 （也被称为 HTTP 方法 ）。 /items/{item_id} 路径 有一个 路径参数 item_id 并且应该为 int 类型。 /items/{item_id} 路径 有一个可选的 str 类型的 查询参数 q 。 交互式 API 文档 现在访问 http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs 。 你会看到自动生成的交互式 API 文档（由 Swagger UI 生成）： 可选的 API 文档 访问 http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc 。 你会看到另一个自动生成的文档（由 ReDoc 生成）： 示例升级 现在修改 main.py 文件来从 PUT 请求中接收请求体。 我们借助 Pydantic 来使用标准的 Python 类型声明请求体。 from typing import Union from fastapi import FastAPI from pydantic import BaseModel app = FastAPI () class Item ( BaseModel ): name : str price : float is_offer : Union [ bool , None ] = None @app . get ( \"/\" ) def read_root (): return { \"Hello\" : \"World\" } @app . get ( \"/items/ {item_id} \" ) def read_item ( item_id : int , q : Union [ str , None ] = None ): return { \"item_id\" : item_id , \"q\" : q } @app . put ( \"/items/ {item_id} \" ) def update_item ( item_id : int , item : Item ): return { \"item_name\" : item . name , \"item_id\" : item_id } 服务器将会自动重载（因为在上面的步骤中你向 uvicorn 命令添加了 --reload 选项）。 交互式 API 文档升级 访问 http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs 。 交互式 API 文档将会自动更新，并加入新的请求体： 点击「Try it out」按钮，之后你可以填写参数并直接调用 API： 然后点击「Execute」按钮，用户界面将会和 API 进行通信，发送参数，获取结果并在屏幕上展示： 可选文档升级 访问 http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc 。 总结 总的来说，你就像声明函数的参数类型一样只声明了 一次 请求参数、请求体等的类型。 你使用了标准的现代 Python 类型来完成声明。 你不需要去学习新的语法、了解特定库的方法或类，等等。 只需要使用标准的 Python 及更高版本 。 举个例子，比如声明 int 类型： 或者一个更复杂的 Item 模型： ......在进行一次声明之后，你将获得： 编辑器支持，包括： 数据校验： 在校验失败时自动生成清晰的错误信息 对多层嵌套的 JSON 对象依然执行校验 转换 来自网络请求的输入数据为 Python 数据类型。包括以下数据： JSON 路径参数 查询参数 Cookies 请求头 表单 文件 转换 输出的数据：转换 Python 数据类型为供网络传输的 JSON 数据： 转换 Python 基础类型 （ str 、 int 、 float 、 bool 、 list 等） datetime 对象 UUID 对象 数据库模型 ......以及更多其他类型 自动生成的交互式 API 文档，包括两种可选的用户界面： 回到前面的代码示例， FastAPI 将会： 校验 GET 和 PUT 请求的路径中是否含有 item_id 。 校验 GET 和 PUT 请求中的 item_id 是否为 int 类型。 检查 GET 请求中是否有命名为 q 的可选查询参数（比如 http://127.0.0.1:8000/items/foo?q=somequery ）。 因为 q 被声明为 = None ，所以它是可选的。 如果没有 None 它将会是必需的 (如 PUT 例子中的请求体)。 对于访问 /items/{item_id} 的 PUT 请求，将请求体读取为 JSON 并： 检查是否有必需属性 name 并且值为 str 类型 。 检查是否有必需属性 price 并且值为 float 类型。 检查是否有可选属性 is_offer ， 如果有的话值应该为 bool 类型。 以上过程对于多层嵌套的 JSON 对象同样也会执行 自动对 JSON 进行转换或转换成 JSON。 通过 OpenAPI 文档来记录所有内容，可被用于： 交互式文档系统 许多编程语言的客户端代码自动生成系统 直接提供 2 种交互式文档 web 界面。 虽然我们才刚刚开始，但其实你已经了解了这一切是如何工作的。 尝试更改下面这行代码： return { \"item_name\" : item . name , \"item_id\" : item_id } ......从： ... \"item_name\" : item . name ... ......改为： ... \"item_price\" : item . price ... ......注意观察编辑器是如何自动补全属性并且还知道它们的类型： 教程 - 用户指南 中有包含更多特性的更完整示例。 剧透警告 ： 教程 - 用户指南中的内容有： 对来自不同地方的参数进行声明，如： 请求头 、 cookies 、 form 表单 以及 上传的文件 。 如何设置 校验约束 如 maximum_length 或者 regex 。 一个强大并易于使用的 依赖注入 系统。 安全性和身份验证，包括通过 JWT 令牌 和 HTTP 基本身份认证 来支持 OAuth2 。 更进阶（但同样简单）的技巧来声明 多层嵌套 JSON 模型 （借助 Pydantic）。 许多额外功能（归功于 Starlette）比如： WebSockets GraphQL 基于 HTTPX 和 pytest 的极其简单的测试 CORS Cookie Sessions ......以及更多 性能 独立机构 TechEmpower 所作的基准测试结果显示，基于 Uvicorn 运行的 FastAPI 程序是 最快的 Python web 框架之一 ，仅次于 Starlette 和 Uvicorn 本身（FastAPI 内部使用了它们）。(*) 想了解更多，请查阅 基准测试 章节。 可选依赖 用于 Pydantic： 用于 Starlette： 用于 FastAPI / Starlette： uvicorn - 用于加载和运行你的应用程序的服务器。 orjson - 使用 ORJSONResponse 时安装。 ujson - 使用 UJSONResponse 时安装。 你可以通过 pip install \"fastapi[all]\" 命令来安装以上所有依赖。 许可协议 该项目遵循 MIT 许可协议。",

    "https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/features/": "Features FastAPI features FastAPI gives you the following: Based on open standards OpenAPI for API creation, including declarations of path operations , parameters, request bodies, security, etc. Automatic data model documentation with JSON Schema (as OpenAPI itself is based on JSON Schema). Designed around these standards, after a meticulous study. Instead of an afterthought layer on top. This also allows using automatic client code generation in many languages. Automatic docs Interactive API documentation and exploration web user interfaces. As the framework is based on OpenAPI, there are multiple options, 2 included by default. Swagger UI , with interactive exploration, call and test your API directly from the browser. Alternative API documentation with ReDoc . Just Modern Python It's all based on standard Python type declarations (thanks to Pydantic). No new syntax to learn. Just standard modern Python. If you need a 2 minute refresher of how to use Python types (even if you don't use FastAPI), check the short tutorial: Python Types . You write standard Python with types: from datetime import date from pydantic import BaseModel # Declare a variable as a str # and get editor support inside the function def main ( user_id : str ): return user_id # A Pydantic model class User ( BaseModel ): id : int name : str joined : date That can then be used like: my_user : User = User ( id = 3 , name = \"John Doe\" , joined = \"2018-07-19\" ) second_user_data = { \"id\" : 4 , \"name\" : \"Mary\" , \"joined\" : \"2018-11-30\" , } my_second_user : User = User ( ** second_user_data ) Info **second_user_data means: Pass the keys and values of the second_user_data dict directly as key-value arguments, equivalent to: User(id=4, name=\"Mary\", joined=\"2018-11-30\") Editor support All the framework was designed to be easy and intuitive to use, all the decisions were tested on multiple editors even before starting development, to ensure the best development experience. In the Python developer surveys, it's clear that one of the most used features is \"autocompletion\" . The whole FastAPI framework is based to satisfy that. Autocompletion works everywhere. You will rarely need to come back to the docs. Here's how your editor might help you: You will get completion in code you might even consider impossible before. As for example, the price key inside a JSON body (that could have been nested) that comes from a request. No more typing the wrong key names, coming back and forth between docs, or scrolling up and down to find if you finally used username or user_name . Short It has sensible defaults for everything, with optional configurations everywhere. All the parameters can be fine-tuned to do what you need and to define the API you need. But by default, it all \"just works\" . Validation Validation for most (or all?) Python data types , including: JSON objects ( dict ). JSON array ( list ) defining item types. String ( str ) fields, defining min and max lengths. Numbers ( int , float ) with min and max values, etc. Validation for more exotic types, like: URL. Email. UUID. ...and others. All the validation is handled by the well-established and robust Pydantic . Security and authentication Security and authentication integrated. Without any compromise with databases or data models. All the security schemes defined in OpenAPI, including: HTTP Basic. OAuth2 (also with JWT tokens ). Check the tutorial on OAuth2 with JWT . API keys in: Headers. Query parameters. Cookies, etc. Plus all the security features from Starlette (including session cookies ). All built as reusable tools and components that are easy to integrate with your systems, data stores, relational and NoSQL databases, etc. Dependency Injection FastAPI includes an extremely easy to use, but extremely powerful Dependency Injection system. Even dependencies can have dependencies, creating a hierarchy or \"graph\" of dependencies . All automatically handled by the framework. All the dependencies can require data from requests and augment the path operation constraints and automatic documentation. Automatic validation even for path operation parameters defined in dependencies. Support for complex user authentication systems, database connections , etc. No compromise with databases, frontends, etc. But easy integration with all of them. Unlimited \"plug-ins\" Or in other way, no need for them, import and use the code you need. Any integration is designed to be so simple to use (with dependencies) that you can create a \"plug-in\" for your application in 2 lines of code using the same structure and syntax used for your path operations . Tested 100% test coverage . 100% type annotated code base. Used in production applications. Starlette features FastAPI is fully compatible with (and based on) Starlette . So, any additional Starlette code you have, will also work. FastAPI is actually a sub-class of Starlette . So, if you already know or use Starlette, most of the functionality will work the same way. With FastAPI you get all of Starlette 's features (as FastAPI is just Starlette on steroids): Pydantic features FastAPI is fully compatible with (and based on) Pydantic . So, any additional Pydantic code you have, will also work. Including external libraries also based on Pydantic, as ORM s, ODM s for databases. This also means that in many cases you can pass the same object you get from a request directly to the database , as everything is validated automatically. The same applies the other way around, in many cases you can just pass the object you get from the database directly to the client . With FastAPI you get all of Pydantic 's features (as FastAPI is based on Pydantic for all the data handling): No brainfuck : No new schema definition micro-language to learn. If you know Python types you know how to use Pydantic. Plays nicely with your IDE / linter /brain : Because pydantic data structures are just instances of classes you define; auto-completion, linting, mypy and your intuition should all work properly with your validated data. Validate complex structures : Use of hierarchical Pydantic models, Python typing ’s List and Dict , etc. And validators allow complex data schemas to be clearly and easily defined, checked and documented as JSON Schema. You can have deeply nested JSON objects and have them all validated and annotated. Extensible : Pydantic allows custom data types to be defined or you can extend validation with methods on a model decorated with the validator decorator. 100% test coverage.",
