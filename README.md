# 🧠 RAG Web Project — Website Crawler + Index + Q&A API

## 📋 Overview
This project implements a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline that crawls a website, extracts and indexes its textual content, and answers user questions grounded **strictly** in the crawled data — with **citations** of source URLs.

---

## ⚙️ Architecture
**Pipeline Flow:**


LLM: Open-source local (e.g., gemini api)

```bash
Crawl Website → Extract & Clean Text → Chunk & Embed → Store in Vector Index → Retrieve Top-K → Generate Grounded Answer

```
    
## Main Components:
| Component | Description                                                                                 |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/crawl`  | Crawls website pages (within domain), respecting `robots.txt`.                              |
| `/index`  | Chunks text, creates embeddings using `SentenceTransformer`, and stores FAISS index.        |
| `/ask`    | Retrieves top-K context chunks, generates grounded answer, and returns citations + timings. |

### 💾 Setup Instructions
1. Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/rag-web.git
cd rag-web
```

2. Create Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate   
```

3. Install Requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Run the Backend
```bash
cd backend
uvicorn server:app --reload

```

5. Open Frontend (HTML)
```bash
 Open frontend/index.html in your browser.
 http://127.0.0.1:3000/frontend/index.html

```
### 📊 Example Demo Flow
* Crawl → Provide a website (e.g., https://fastapi.tiangolo.com)
* Index → Choose chunk size and embedding model (default: all-MiniLM-L6-v2)
* Ask → Ask a question like “What is FastAPI?”
* Observe → The model answers using only crawled text, citing sources.



### Design Choices & Tradeoffs

* ✅ Chunk Size (800) — balanced between retrieval precision and context coherence.
* ✅ Overlap (100) — ensures no important information is split across chunks.
* ✅ Embedding Model — all-MiniLM-L6-v2 chosen for speed + good semantic accuracy.
* ✅ FAISS used for fast similarity search.
* ✅ Politeness — respects robots.txt and includes a crawl delay.
* ✅ Grounding — model refuses with “not found in crawled content” when unsure.
* ⚠️ Limitation: No JavaScript-rendered pages; only static HTML text supported.
* ⚙️ Future Work: Add persistence DB and improved text cleaning.



 ### 🔒Safety & Guardrails
 
 * Refuses to answer out-of-domain questions.
 * Ignores any “prompt injection” instructions inside crawled pages.
 * Logs retrieval + generation latency for monitoring.
